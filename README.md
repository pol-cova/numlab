# NumLab

NumLab is a web application designed to help students and enthusiasts learn and apply numerical methods interactively. Built with **FastAPI** on the backend and **HTMX** on the frontend, it provides a dynamic environment for solving mathematical problems and implementing numerical algorithms.

## Why NumLab?

During our studies, my classmates and I found it challenging to understand and apply numerical methods effectively. Traditional learning methods often lack interactivity, making it harder to grasp concepts deeply. **NumLab** was created to bridge this gap by offering an intuitive platform where users can experiment with numerical methods in real-time. Whether you're solving equations, performing interpolations, or working on differential equations, **NumLab** aims to make numerical methods more accessible and engaging.

## Features

- ðŸ§® **Interactive Numerical Methods** â€“ Solve problems using various numerical techniques.
- âš¡ **FastAPI Backend** â€“ Ensuring high performance and scalability.
- ðŸ”¥ **HTMX-Based Frontend** â€“ Providing a smooth and reactive UI.
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization Support** â€“ Generate plots and graphs for better understanding.
- ðŸ›  **Extensible** â€“ Easily add new numerical methods and expand functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTMX, TailwindCSS
- **Database:** SQLite (or other relational databases)
- **Other Tools:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (for numerical computations and visualizations)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pipenv or virtualenv (recommended for dependency management)

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numlab.git
cd numlab

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
```

Then, open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to start using NumLab!
